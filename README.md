# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard ❤️

This project presents a detailed **Power BI dashboard** analyzing survival statistics among heart failure patients. The data includes various health and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, serum creatinine levels, ejection fraction, smoking, anaemia, high blood pressure, and diabetes. The dashboard is designed to help healthcare professionals, analysts, and researchers identify key trends and health risk factors.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project uses **sample data only**, not actual hospital records. The original dataset is modified to ensure confidentiality and learning purposes.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a **business intelligence (BI)** dashboard that:

- Visualizes survival metrics of heart failure patients.
- Highlights patterns based on medical conditions and demographics.
- Identifies risk indicators that correlate with higher mortality.
- Helps stakeholders draw actionable insights using visual analytics.

## 📈 Key Metrics & Visual Insights

### 🧮 Survival Summary
- **Survival Rate**: `67.89%`
- **Average Age of Survivors**: `58.76 years`
- **Total Survivors**: `203`
- **Total Deaths**: `96`

### 📊 Dashboards and Insights

1. **Survival vs Serum Creatinine by Age Group**
   - Indicates correlation between kidney function and survival.
   - Visualizes average serum creatinine for survivors per age group.

2. **Ejection Fraction by Age Group**
   - Shows how heart pumping efficiency impacts survival.
   - Clear age-related trends are visualized using bar and line charts.

3. **Survival Rate by Age Group**
   - Displays how survival rates decline as age increases.
   - Highest survival rate found in 61–70 years age group (75.90%).

4. **Impact of Risk Factors**
   - Binary flags (Yes/No) for smoking, diabetes, anaemia, and high blood pressure.
   - Tracks how each risk factor affects mortality.

5. **Gender-Based Survival Breakdown**
   - Comparative analysis of survival between males and females.
   - Gender filter applied for targeted insights.
